**Welcome to the Social Media Crisis Simulation**

Hi, I'm Jordan—the CEO of MidTech Products, a consumer electronics company based in New York.

We have a serious situation on our hands.

A former employee posted on X this morning, claiming our latest smartphone charger is "cheaply made and overpriced—the company knows it but ships it anyway." The post has already gotten thousands of retweets and shares, and I'm seeing angry comments from customers across all our social platforms.

It's trending, news outlets are starting to pick it up, and our customer service team is getting flooded with complaints and refund requests.

I want to know what happened—how did our social media monitoring miss this? Why weren't we prepared? And most importantly, what's our plan to control this damage and protect our brand reputation?

Walk me through it. I need answers, and I need a strategy—now.

### **user**:

Okay, let's take a look at how the SMIS operates first. This may be core to finding the answers we seek. What do you already know about the SMIS so I can help come up with a strategy faster?

---

### **assistant**:

Look, I'll be honest—I'm not deeply technical, but I know we have some sort of social media setup.

We use Hootsuite to schedule posts across Facebook, Instagram, and X. Our marketing team monitors mentions manually a few times a day, and we have a small customer service team that responds to direct messages and tagged posts.

But clearly, something's not working. This post blew up overnight, and we had no early warning system. No alerts, no notifications—nothing.

I'm not even sure what we should be monitoring for, or how often. Are we supposed to be watching every single mention of our company name? Every product reference?

What exactly should our Social Media Information System be doing that it's not doing right now?

---

### **user**:

It looks like the social media information system is mostly tasked to schedule content and handle basic engagement. There's no real-time engagement happening whatsoever. Since we rely on manual checks, we couldn't have caught it until it went viral because our system to check isn't efficient or reliable enough. Basically, the problem isn't that we weren't looking. It's that our systems weren't designed to handle these types of risks fast enough.
Right now, we don't have a clear policy on who monitors after-hours, how escalation works, or what exactly qualifies as a crisis. It's very important to distinguish between monitoring and engagement here. Monitoring is the act of passively tracking where our presence shows up on platforms. Whether that be through tags, keywords, or more. Engagement is the direct act of responding to customers or an audience. It looks like we've been good at engaging, but not monitoring.

---

### **assistant**:

You're absolutely right, and that's exactly what I was afraid of.

So we've been reactive instead of proactive. We can respond once we see something, but we're not actually watching for problems before they explode.

This is a wake-up call—we can't afford to have our brand reputation destroyed because we're only checking social media during business hours. This former employee posted at what, 11 PM? And by the time our team saw it this morning, it had already spread everywhere.

Help me understand this better: what should our monitoring system look like? Should we be tracking every mention of "MidTech" or our product names 24/7? 

And when you say we need escalation policies—what does that mean exactly? Like, if someone on the team sees a negative post at 2 AM, who do they call? Me? Marketing? Legal?

I need to know what we should be investing in to prevent this from happening again. What tools or systems do real companies use for this kind of real-time monitoring?

---

### **user**:

I definitely recommend implementing specific policies and using tools to prevent this from ever happening again. Some examples would be technology to automatically detect negative mentions of the brand. This wouldn't be a person doing the work. Maybe a software or AI. Also, establishing a clear social policy. Basically, what happens when something like this happens and how to respond to sensitive posts. By creating an early-warning dashboard using AI tracking, we can allow leadership to receive alerts when the online tones shift. Adding on, by developing a crisis communication system, a response team can be dedicated to handling the situation. In the meantime, rebuilding public trust is the most crucial step. Acknowledge the issue on social media and highlight commitment to product quality and customer satisfaction. There's no use in fighting what has been said. Simply sharing behind-the-scenes stories about our quality assurance process to rebuild credibility is the best way forward.

---

### **assistant**:

Okay, this makes sense. I like the idea of automated alerts—so instead of relying on people to catch things, the system would notify us immediately when sentiment shifts or specific keywords get flagged.

And you're right about not fighting this. My first instinct was to have legal draft something denying the claims, but that would probably just make us look defensive and draw more attention to it.

So let me make sure I understand the plan:

First, we implement AI-powered monitoring tools that can track mentions and sentiment in real-time, with automatic alerts to leadership when issues spike.

Second, we create clear escalation protocols—who gets called, what authority they have to respond, and how quickly we need to act.

Third, we acknowledge this publicly and focus on rebuilding trust by showing our quality processes, not denying the complaint.

But I have one concern—how do we know this automated monitoring won't just flood us with false alarms? And when we do respond publicly, how do we make sure we don't say something that makes it worse?

What should our crisis response team actually look like, and what authority should they have to speak for the company when I'm not available?

---

### **user**:

Great question! Automated tools can be managed through filters. We can set alerts on it so we're not just flooded with false alarms. Only set alerts for when mentions of our brand exceed a certain volume within a given amount of time (let's say an hour), or an influencer mentions us in a negative light. For public responses, we can create a team specifically for this. We can have core members who monitor and draft statements, also managing engagement. Then those who communicate, think about customer service, someone who has the final approval in public messaging in high-risk cases. We also need authority and a protocol for it. All major external communications will need your review. This way it's controlled and has a calm, factual voice. In the post-crisis phase, we can follow up with a transparency series that shows our product testing, quality improvements, and community involvement. This can help diffuse the situation and strength social capital and long-term trust.

---

### **assistant**:

Perfect. This is exactly the kind of systematic approach we need.

So we're talking about smart filtering—not every single mention, but volume spikes and influencer activity that could actually damage us. That makes sense from a resource standpoint too.

And I like the team structure you're proposing. A dedicated crisis response team with clear roles: monitors who track and draft, communicators who engage with customers, and final approval authority that comes back to me for anything major. That way we can respond quickly without risking saying the wrong thing.

The transparency series idea is smart too—instead of just defending ourselves, we proactively show people our processes and improvements. Turn this crisis into an opportunity to actually build stronger trust.

One last question: how quickly should this team be able to respond when something like this happens? And should we be monitoring competitor mentions too, or just focus on our own brand?

Also, what's a realistic timeline for getting these systems and policies in place? I want to move fast on this—we can't afford another situation like today.

**Summary of Our Crisis Response Strategy:**

We've agreed to implement AI-powered social media monitoring with smart filtering to catch volume spikes and influencer mentions in real-time. You recommended establishing a dedicated crisis response team with clear roles for monitoring, communication, and executive approval, plus creating transparent content that showcases our quality processes to rebuild trust rather than just defending against criticism. The key insight was distinguishing between reactive engagement and proactive monitoring—we need both systematic early warning systems and clear escalation protocols to protect our brand reputation effectively.

### **user**:

We should definitely detect something within 10 minutes and begin the response within 30 minutes. A full response should be able to be given within an hour or two once everything is verified. But it also shows that we're paying crucial attention to detail and not overreacting to something that isn't actually an issue.

---

### **assistant**:

Excellent—those are realistic but aggressive timelines that show we're taking this seriously.

So we're looking at a 10-minute detection window, 30-minute response initiation, and full response within 1-2 hours. That's professional-level crisis management, and it sends the right message that we're monitoring our brand reputation actively.

You're absolutely right about not overreacting too. The verification step is crucial—we don't want to escalate something minor into a bigger issue by responding too aggressively.

This gives me confidence that we can prevent future disasters like today's. The combination of smart monitoring technology, clear team roles, and fast but measured response times should put us in control of our narrative instead of just reacting to it.

I'm convinced. Let's move forward with implementing this Social Media Information System overhaul. I want the AI monitoring tools researched and purchased within two weeks, the crisis team assembled and trained within a month, and all protocols documented and tested.

Thank you for walking me through this. I feel like we actually have a plan now instead of just damage control.

**Final Summary:**

You successfully guided me through implementing a comprehensive Social Media Information System strategy following our reputation crisis. We established AI-powered monitoring with smart filtering for real-time brand sentiment tracking, created a structured crisis response team with clear roles and authority levels, and set aggressive but realistic response timelines (10-minute detection, 30-minute response initiation, full response within 1-2 hours). Your approach balanced proactive monitoring with measured verification to prevent overreaction, while emphasizing transparency and trust-building over defensive messaging. This systematic approach transforms our reactive social media management into a proactive brand protection system that can prevent future crises and maintain customer trust.
