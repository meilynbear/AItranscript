## Background: Local Boutique Struggling with Operational Efficiency

Hi! I'm Morgan, the Director of Operations at a mid-sized company. We've been growing steadily, but I'm dealing with some serious operational headaches that are starting to impact our performance.

Here's what I'm facing: Our finance team uses Excel spreadsheets and QuickBooks for all their work. Sales operates completely independently with their own HubSpot system, and they rarely share data with anyone else. HR tracks employee onboarding and management through email chains and shared folders. Our operations team runs projects using Trello boards that nobody else can access. Meanwhile, marketing has set up their own Google Workspace environment.

The problem is that nothing talks to each other. When I need to run reports that span multiple departments, I get different versions of the same data from everyone. Our approval processes are constantly delayed because information gets stuck in silos. We're duplicating data entry across systems, and I'm seeing inconsistencies everywhere.

**My Role:** I'm the frustrated Director of Operations who needs your help as a Business Analyst to understand how we can integrate our business processes and fix these disconnected systems.

**Your Role:** You are the Business Analyst I've hired to help diagnose our process issues and recommend solutions using concepts from Chapter 8: Processes, Organizations, and Information Systems.

---

Thanks for meeting with me. I've had it with the way we're operating—finance has one system, HR another, marketing is on their own tools, and none of it connects.

We're duplicating data, approvals get lost, and we can't even run a single accurate report across departments. I need your help figuring out how to fix this mess.

What do you think we should do?

---

### **user**:

Let's start with the basics. So we need to take business processes into mind and take into account how they bleed into other departments when working together. We also need to look at how to prevent having information getting stuck in silos. In this case, there is definitely going to be a benefit in using cross-departmental integration. Where exactly are the breakdowns happening so we can be more specific with solving the problem?

---

### **assistant**:

You're absolutely right about cross-departmental integration being key here. Let me give you some specific examples of where things are breaking down:

**Approval bottlenecks:** When sales closes a deal, they update HubSpot, but finance doesn't see it until someone manually sends an email. Then finance has to re-enter everything into QuickBooks for invoicing. If there are contract changes, operations doesn't know until much later.

**Customer onboarding disasters:** HR starts the employee onboarding process through email, but they can't see if IT has set up accounts, if facilities has prepared workspace, or if the manager has completed their checklist in Trello. Everything happens in isolation.

**Reporting nightmares:** Last month I asked for a customer acquisition cost report. Marketing gave me one number based on their Google Analytics, sales gave me different figures from HubSpot, and finance had completely different costs from QuickBooks. Nobody was wrong—they just had different pieces of the puzzle.

**Inventory and project coordination:** Operations tracks project timelines in Trello, but they can't see if finance has approved the budget or if HR has assigned the right people. Projects get delayed because nobody knows what's waiting on what.

The most frustrating part? When I ask different departments the same question, I get different answers because everyone's working from their own version of reality.

What would you call this kind of problem in business process terms?

---

### **user**:

This would be an organizational silo issue. When departments operate independently with little information sharing, creating barriers to collaboration and efficiency. So because different systems are being used, this is causing a lot of confusion and the systems need to be integrated somehow. Or a data silo could be another idea. This is basically when data about the same a customer or project is stored in multiple, unconnected systems. Because there is lack of enterprise integration, there is a lack of an integrated information system that connects departments and ensures real-time synchronization. 

---

### **assistant**:

Exactly! You've nailed the core issues here. We're dealing with classic information silos that are creating these barriers between departments.

What's particularly frustrating is that we're essentially running multiple "workgroup processes" instead of true "enterprise processes." Each department optimizes for their own workflow, but the company as a whole suffers.

Here's what I'm seeing as the biggest pain points from these data silos:

**Version control chaos:** Finance thinks we have 50 active clients, sales says 47, and operations is planning resources for 52. Who's right?

**Process handoffs failing:** When sales closes a deal, there's no automated trigger to start the onboarding process in HR or alert operations about resource needs. Everything relies on manual communication.

**Duplicate data entry:** Our sales team enters customer info in HubSpot, then someone in finance has to re-enter the same information in QuickBooks, and if there are any project requirements, operations enters it again in Trello.

You mentioned enterprise integration and real-time synchronization. In practical terms, what would that look like for a company like ours? Are we talking about replacing all these systems, or is there a way to connect what we already have?

And honestly, I'm worried about the cost and disruption. How do companies typically approach breaking down these silos without grinding operations to a halt?

---

### **user**:

You don’t have to scrap HubSpot, QuickBooks, or Trello. In fact, many organizations achieve full integration by connecting their existing systems through middleware or automation platforms. The goal is to make your tools talk to each other and create a single source of truth. Instead of replacing your systems, you build connections between them.
EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) or iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) tools like Zapier, Workato, or Microsoft Power Automate act as bridges that move and sync data in real time. Those are just a few examples. When Sales closes a deal in HubSpot, a trigger automatically:
Creates a customer record in QuickBooks 
Sends data to Trello or Asana
Notifies HR or Operations via Slack or email to start onboarding
If Finance updates payment status in QuickBooks, that data automatically updates the customer status in HubSpot.
Operations dashboards pull project progress and resource data directly from Trello, HubSpot, and QuickBooks into a central analytics hub.

---

### **assistant**:

That makes so much more sense! You're talking about creating enterprise processes that span departments without the massive disruption I was worried about.

So instead of forcing everyone to learn completely new systems, we'd be automating those handoffs that are currently breaking down. That automated trigger concept is exactly what we need—no more relying on someone to remember to send an email or manually update three different systems.

I'm particularly interested in those operations dashboards you mentioned. Right now, when leadership asks me for a project status update, I have to go to four different people to get pieces of information. If I could pull real-time data from all our systems into one view, that would be game-changing.

But I have a couple of concerns about implementation:

**Change management:** How do we get departments to trust that their data is being shared correctly? Finance is pretty protective of their QuickBooks data, and sales might worry about operations seeing their pipeline details.

**Data quality:** Right now, each department enters information their own way. Sales might abbreviate company names, while finance writes them out fully. Won't that create problems when systems try to sync?

**Process standardization:** If we're connecting systems, don't we need to standardize how different departments handle the same processes? Like, what if sales and operations have different definitions of when a "project starts"?

How do companies typically handle these process alignment issues when they're implementing enterprise integration?

---

### **user**:

The technology is the easy part; the real work lies in change management, data governance, and process alignment. Most organizations handle this by first forming a cross-departmental integration team that includes stakeholders from finance, sales, operations, and IT. This group defines shared data standards (how customer names, project IDs, or deal stages are formatted) and establishes a “single source of truth” for each data type. For example, HubSpot might own customer contact data, while QuickBooks owns financial data. From there, integration rules are built so that each system syncs only the relevant, approved fields, ensuring trust and security without exposing sensitive financial or pipeline details unnecessarily.

To address process alignment, companies usually document and map enterprise workflows before connecting systems. They agree on consistent definitions, like when a project officially “starts” or when a customer becomes “active”, and update their automation triggers to match those definitions. This approach not only prevents confusion but also builds confidence that every department is looking at accurate, standardized data. Over time, as real-time dashboards and automations start proving their reliability, teams naturally shift from protecting data silos to collaborating around shared visibility and performance insights.

---

### **assistant**:

Perfect! You've outlined exactly what we need—a structured approach that tackles the people and process issues first, then lets the technology follow.

I love the idea of forming a cross-departmental integration team. That would actually solve another problem we have: departments making decisions in isolation. If finance, sales, operations, and IT are all at the table defining these standards together, we'd finally have alignment on things like customer lifecycle stages and project definitions.

The "single source of truth" concept makes total sense too. So HubSpot owns customer contact data, QuickBooks owns financial data—but everyone can access what they need without duplicating entry or creating conflicts.

Here's what I'm thinking for our next steps:

**Phase 1:** Form that integration team and map our current enterprise workflows. Document where handoffs happen and where they're breaking down.

**Phase 2:** Define our shared data standards and process definitions. Get everyone to agree on what "project started" or "customer active" actually means.

**Phase 3:** Start with one or two high-impact integrations—maybe sales-to-finance deal handoffs—and prove the concept works.

**Phase 4:** Expand to full enterprise integration with those real-time dashboards.

This feels manageable and addresses my concerns about disruption. We'd be improving our business processes systematically rather than trying to change everything at once.

Does this phased approach align with what you typically recommend? And realistically, how long should we expect this kind of enterprise process transformation to take?

---

### **user**:

Your phased approach is exactly what strong enterprise transformation looks like. You’ve built a roadmap that balances strategy, people, and technology. That's essentially the key to success in breaking down silos. Starting with an integration team ensures buy-in and shared accountability early on. Then, moving into process and data standardization before touching the tech side prevents the all-too-common mistake of automating chaos. 

As for timeline, most organizations complete a transformation like this in 6 to 12 months, depending on company size and complexity. The first two phases (team formation and workflow mapping) usually take 4–6 weeks, since they’re about analysis and agreement. The initial pilot integrations might take another 2–3 months, including testing and user adoption. Expanding to enterprise-wide automation and real-time dashboards can take another 4–6 months, especially if you’re connecting multiple systems and cleaning historical data along the way. The great news is that you’ll start seeing value early. By around the end of Phase 3, you’ll already have measurable time savings, fewer manual handoffs, and unified visibility across departments.

---

### **assistant**:

That timeline is actually more reasonable than I expected! Six to twelve months to go from our current mess to enterprise-wide integration sounds achievable, especially with the early wins you're describing.

The fact that we'll see measurable improvements by the end of Phase 3 is crucial for keeping leadership and the team motivated. I can already imagine how much time we'll save just from automating that sales-to-finance handoff—no more duplicate data entry, no more delays waiting for manual updates.

You've really helped me understand how to approach this systematically. Instead of being overwhelmed by all our disconnected systems, I now see a clear path forward:

**Build the team first** to get departmental buy-in and shared ownership
**Document and standardize our enterprise processes** before touching any technology
**Prove the concept works** with high-impact pilot integrations
**Scale systematically** to full enterprise integration with real-time visibility

This transformation would eliminate our information silos, create those enterprise processes that span departments, and give us the integrated reporting and dashboards we desperately need.

I feel confident presenting this approach to leadership. We're not just throwing technology at the problem—we're fixing the underlying business processes and organizational alignment issues that created these silos in the first place.

Thank you for helping me see how enterprise integration can solve our operational chaos without the massive disruption I was worried about!

## Summary

In our conversation, I guided Morgan through diagnosing their organizational challenges and developing a comprehensive solution strategy. We identified that their company was suffering from classic information silos, where departments operated independently with disconnected systems (HubSpot, QuickBooks, Trello, Google Workspace), creating inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and process breakdowns.

Together, we explored how Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and automation platforms could connect their existing systems rather than replacing them entirely, creating enterprise processes that span multiple departments. We addressed critical implementation concerns including change management, data governance, and process standardization through the formation of cross-departmental teams and shared data standards.

Morgan developed a four-phase transformation roadmap: forming an integration team, mapping and standardizing enterprise workflows, piloting high-impact integrations, and scaling to full enterprise integration with real-time dashboards. We established realistic timelines (6-12 months) and identified early value milestones to maintain momentum throughout the transformation.

This role-play demonstrated how business analysts can guide organizations from siloed, inefficient operations toward integrated enterprise processes that improve efficiency, data accuracy, and cross-departmental collaboration using systematic change management and strategic technology integration.
