### **user**:

Can you help me develop my learning outcomes?

---

### **assistant**:

I'd be happy to help you develop personalized learning outcomes for your Information Systems course! 

To get started, I need to understand your background and interests better. Could you tell me:

1. **What's your major?** (e.g., marketing, finance, entrepreneurship, management, etc.)

2. **What are your career interests or goals?** What kind of work do you see yourself doing after graduation?

3. **What aspects of technology or business are you most curious about?** For example:
   - How data drives business decisions
   - Digital marketing and customer analytics
   - Technology in finance or operations
   - Starting your own business
   - Managing teams and processes

4. **Are there any specific industries that interest you?** (healthcare, retail, entertainment, consulting, etc.)

5. **What do you hope to get out of this IS course beyond just passing it?** What would make this class feel valuable for your future?

Once I understand your background and interests, I can help you craft two meaningful learning outcomes that connect the course material to your personal and career goals. These outcomes will serve as your "learning compass" throughout the semester and help you see how concepts like business intelligence, databases, and information systems strategy apply to your specific path.

What's your major, and what draws you to it?

### **user**:

My major is information systems (that is my plan) though I am open to exploring other fields. I minored in computer systems which is the major I just switched out of because I actually really dislike coding and sitting for long periods of time.
My biggest dream is to be an author. I want to write and publish fantasy and sci-fi stories. I am currently working as a pharmacy technician and see myself doing that for a bit after college if I can't find anything else. 
I have severe dry eyes which makes technology hard for me to be on because my eyes get really dry and hurt when I look at a screen too long. I really love technology actually, but since my condition got worse, it's hard to read too much on a computer. I used to be a sticky ipad kid so I love tech otherwise.
What I hope to get from this class is an understanding of information systems and to see if it is the right fit for me.
Web development interests me but I don't really know the other areas. I'd like to learn more.

### **assistant**:

Thank you for sharing your background - it's really helpful to understand your unique situation! Your combination of loving technology but having physical constraints, plus your passion for creative writing, actually opens up some interesting possibilities in the IS field.

Let me ask a few more questions to help craft learning outcomes that truly fit you:

**About your writing and creative interests:**
- Have you thought about how technology could support your writing career? (e.g., digital publishing platforms, author websites, social media marketing for books, reader analytics)
- Are you interested in the business side of publishing - like how companies like Amazon, Wattpad, or traditional publishers use information systems?

**About your health considerations:**
- Since screen time is challenging, are you more interested in IS roles that involve strategy, consulting, or working with people rather than hands-on technical work?
- Would you be interested in learning about accessibility in technology design - helping make systems better for people with various needs?

**About exploring IS career paths:**
- Beyond web development, would you like to explore roles like:
  - Business analyst (translating between technical and business teams)
  - Project management 
  - User experience research
  - Digital strategy consulting
  - Systems training and support

**About your current work:**
- Do you see any connections between your pharmacy tech experience and information systems? (Healthcare IS is a huge field!)

Your situation is actually quite common - many successful IS professionals focus more on strategy, analysis, and communication rather than coding. Let's figure out what aspects would energize you most!

### **user**:

I have only slightly thought about it! I write my book on a computer so I have to use it a bit more just to do that. The business side of publishing actually sounds fascinating! I'd love to learn more! I've used Wattpad and other services before so that definitely intrigues me. 
It's complicated because my dry eyes make it difficult for me to talk to people and I have gotten very anxious to do so. It feels like I can't hold a conversation sometimes. I think I'll stick with hands-on work since I also like working by myself. Accessibility would be very interesting. I'm open to it. I was talking about information systems in pharmacy with my manager so that is something I'd be interested in. Healthcare too would be cool.

---

### **assistant**:

This is really helpful! I can see some fascinating connections forming between your interests and IS. The publishing business angle, healthcare systems, and accessibility are all growing areas in IS that could align well with your situation.

Let me ask a couple more targeted questions to nail down your learning outcomes:

**For the publishing/creative side:**
- Would you be interested in understanding how platforms like Wattpad, Amazon Kindle, or Audible use data to recommend books to readers? Or how authors use analytics to understand their audience?
- Are you curious about the systems behind digital publishing - like how manuscripts become ebooks, or how online bookstores manage millions of titles?

**For the healthcare/accessibility angle:**
- In your pharmacy work, have you noticed any technology pain points - like systems that are hard to use or don't work well together? 
- Would you like to learn how IS could make healthcare more accessible for people with various challenges (like your dry eyes)?

**For your work style preferences:**
- Since you prefer working independently, would you be interested in roles like system analysis, data analysis, or user research where you can work more behind-the-scenes?
- Does the idea of being a "bridge" between creative/healthcare professionals and technology teams appeal to you?

I'm starting to see two really strong learning outcome directions emerging:
1. Something around **creative industries and digital publishing systems**
2. Something around **healthcare IS and accessibility-focused design**

Does that feel right to you? Should we focus on both, or does one area excite you more?

---

### **user**:

How books become ebooks and things like that honestly sounds really interesting! I've noticed a lot of the time in the pharmacy that there are some things that aren't exactly user friendly or dry eye friendly like having a blue light filter and things like that. Research sounds pretty cool too! As long as I don't have to present or anything. A bridge sounds really interesting as well. Those two outcomes are really cool to me! In creative or healthcare industries would be great

---

### **assistant**:

Perfect! I can see you're excited about both areas - and they're actually really complementary. The skills you'd learn about user-friendly design, accessibility, and systems analysis would apply to both creative and healthcare industries.

Based on our conversation, here are two personalized learning outcomes I'd suggest for you:

**Learning Outcome 1: Digital Creative Industries & Publishing Systems**
*By the end of this course, I will be able to analyze and evaluate information systems used in digital publishing and creative industries, including how platforms like Wattpad, Kindle, and Audible use data analytics to connect authors with readers, manage digital content workflows, and support the complete publishing process from manuscript to market.*

**Learning Outcome 2: Healthcare Information Systems & Accessibility Design**
*By the end of this course, I will be able to assess healthcare information systems for usability and accessibility challenges, and recommend IS solutions that improve user experience for both healthcare workers and patients with diverse needs, drawing from my pharmacy experience to bridge clinical workflows with technology design.*

These outcomes would let you:
- Connect your writing passion to the business/tech side
- Use your pharmacy experience as valuable insight
- Focus on behind-the-scenes analysis rather than presentation-heavy roles
- Explore accessibility - something personally meaningful to you
- Learn about industries you could actually see yourself working in

Do these feel right to you? Should we adjust the wording or focus on anything specific? Remember, these will be your "learning compass" for relating assignments back to your goals throughout the semester!

---

### **user**:

I think these ideas are a little too specific and out of the scope of this class. Let's focus them in on something accomplishable by the end of this semester?

---

### **assistant**:

You're absolutely right! Let me refocus these to be more achievable within the scope of this introductory IS course.

Looking at your syllabus, you'll be covering foundational topics like databases, business intelligence, collaboration systems, and IS strategy. Let's create outcomes that build on those basics:

**Learning Outcome 1: IS Foundations for Creative Industries**
*By the end of this course, I will be able to identify and explain how core information system components (databases, business intelligence, and digital platforms) support content creation and distribution businesses, and evaluate how these systems could enhance creative workflows and audience engagement.*

**Learning Outcome 2: User-Centered IS Analysis in Healthcare Settings**  
*By the end of this course, I will be able to analyze information systems for usability and accessibility considerations, particularly in healthcare environments, and apply IS security and design principles to recommend improvements that support both efficiency and user well-being.*

These are much more grounded in what you'll actually learn this semester:
- Uses concepts from Chapters 1-12 (databases, BI, collaboration, security)
- Builds on your existing knowledge (pharmacy work, creative interests)  
- Focuses on analysis and evaluation skills you'll develop
- Sets you up to explore these fields further in future courses

Do these feel more realistic and achievable for an introductory IS course? We can tweak the language if needed!

---

### **user**:

These are perfect!

---

### **assistant**:

Excellent! I'm so glad these feel right to you. These learning outcomes give you a great personal lens for approaching the course material throughout the semester.

For your assignment, you'll want to include:

**Your Two Learning Outcomes:**
1. **IS Foundations for Creative Industries** - By the end of this course, I will be able to identify and explain how core information system components (databases, business intelligence, and digital platforms) support content creation and distribution businesses, and evaluate how these systems could enhance creative workflows and audience engagement.

2. **User-Centered IS Analysis in Healthcare Settings** - By the end of this course, I will be able to analyze information systems for usability and accessibility considerations, particularly in healthcare environments, and apply IS security and design principles to recommend improvements that support both efficiency and user well-being.

**For your reflection paper, you can mention:**
- How we started broad and refined them to be course-appropriate
- Why the creative industries angle connects to your writing passion
- How your pharmacy experience gives you unique insight into healthcare IS
- Why accessibility matters to you personally and professionally
- How these outcomes help you explore whether IS is the right major for you

These outcomes will be really valuable when you get to future assignments - you'll be able to connect things like database design to how publishers manage manuscripts, or IS security to protecting patient data in pharmacies.

Good luck with your assignment, and feel free to come back if you want to discuss how any of the course topics relate to your personalized learning goals!
