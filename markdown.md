### **assistant**:

Hi Professor! I'm Kenji, the owner of Tour Tokyo Smarter. We run small, customized tours for international visitors here in Tokyo.

Lately, our bookings have been unpredictable and our marketing efforts feel like a shot in the dark. I know we've collected lots of data‚Äîlike customer bookings, reviews, and feedback‚Äîbut I don't know how to use it.

I'm hoping you can help me understand how Business Intelligence systems might turn that data into better decisions. Can you walk me through it?

---

### **user**:

Hi! No problem at all, what kinds of data have you collected so far?

---

### **assistant**:

Well, we've been collecting quite a bit actually! We have customer booking records with dates, tour types, group sizes, and prices. We also track where our customers come from‚Äîwhich countries, how they heard about us.

Plus we get reviews and ratings after each tour, and we keep notes on weather conditions and seasonal patterns. Oh, and we track our marketing spend on different platforms like Google ads and social media.

The problem is, it's all just sitting in different spreadsheets and folders. I can see individual pieces, but I have no idea what it all means together or how to use it to make better business decisions. 

What exactly is Business Intelligence, and how would it help me make sense of all this information?

---

### **user**:

Business Intelligence is basically a strategy to convert raw data into understandable data for anyone to use in order to make business decisions. It would really help to make sense of all this information because all the info is simply sitting in different spreadsheets and folders and isn't organized whatsoever. This can be really discouraging to look at. By using software and systems to organize this data, we can visualize the data to be easy to understand. Examples are by using Tableau. Tableau is a software that can extract information from spreadsheets and allow the user to easily organize data into charts and maps, and basically just any kind of visual aid to better help anyone understand what the information is portraying.

---

### **assistant**:

That makes sense! So Business Intelligence would help me organize all this scattered information into something I can actually understand and use.

I like the idea of using visuals - charts and maps sound much better than staring at endless spreadsheet rows. But I'm curious about the actual process. You mentioned extracting information from spreadsheets - how does that work exactly? 

And once I have these charts and visualizations, what kinds of business decisions could I make that I can't make now? I mean, what would I actually be looking for in all this organized data to help with my tour business?

---

### **user**:

When we extract data from a spreadsheet, I'm assuming you're asking about exactly what we're extracting and how? Let's say for example we have a spreadsheet that has the data about where the customers are from. We can take the countries they are from and put it in a column and then select how many people come from that country in a row so that we can visualize that exactly. Or we can place that data on a map and see the actual countries and how many people come from each of them just popping out of the map.
Once you have these visualizations, types of business decisions that you can make that either you couldn't make before or would've been more difficult to make include: what customers you want to target advertising to less, for example. Maybe you don't really understand the data you have, but then it shows you that you have not as many customers coming in from Europe. So you know not to spend money in advertising to them. Or maybe you have tours not selling well on certain dates; that's able to be visualized way better on a graph because it will show you that no tours are being sold on those dates, so you don't do tours on those days. Or do fewer tours. Does that make sense?

---

### **assistant**:

Yes, that makes perfect sense! So instead of just having numbers scattered everywhere, I could see patterns I never noticed before.

The map visualization sounds really helpful - I could actually see which countries are sending me the most customers and focus my marketing budget there. And the timeline charts would show me exactly when people aren't booking tours.

But I'm wondering about the process you mentioned earlier - you said BI involves data acquisition, analysis, and publishing results. It sounds like we've talked about the analysis part with Tableau. What about the other steps? 

How would I actually get all my scattered data into one place for analysis? And once I create these visualizations, how do I share them with my small team so we can all make better decisions together?

---

### **user**:

Yes, so BI involves data acquisition, analysis, and publishing results. Of course gathering the data comes from somewhere. You already had that part handled with the spreadsheets and folders of data. We need this in order to analyze because we cannot analyze data that isn't collected yet. Publishing results includes visualizing the results at the end. This is the final step after having collected the data, using it then to analyze what needs to be looked at, and then applying that data to real-world business decisions and making those ideas happen. 

You can put all your data into a single dashboard for analysis, as one example. Using the right technology, you should be able to place all of the right information into a single spot to visualize to make the process easier. Once you create these visualizations, you can share them with the team by making your own observations and then sending them to your team because these visualizations aren't just for one person to understand. They should be able to be easily understood by everyone on the team.

---

### **assistant**:

Ah, I see! So I've already been doing the first step - data acquisition - without even realizing it. That's encouraging!

The dashboard idea sounds really useful. Instead of jumping between different spreadsheets and folders, everything would be in one place where my team and I can see it all together.

But I'm still a bit confused about something. You mentioned that BI helps with analysis, but what's the difference between just looking at my data in charts versus actually doing "BI analysis"? Is there more to it than just making pretty visualizations?

And when you say I can share observations with my team - are we talking about just showing them the charts, or is there a way for them to explore the data themselves and maybe discover things I missed?

---

### **user**:

Looking at pretty charts is one thing, but BI analysis is a deeper process of using people and technology together to make this raw data into insights that make you want to take action. With it, you are able to create and predict future outcomes. It goes beyond the simple "what" and dives into the "how" and "why" to explain how things happened in the past. So visualization is about understanding and communication; BI analysis is about transforming data into a strategic asset for business success. 
When you share observations with your team, they can see the data too, but they can also explore the data and analyze parts that maybe you missed as well, you're very right about that! Everyone may be able to pull their own observations from a set of data, which is the great part about visualizing it.

---

### **assistant**:

That's really helpful! So BI analysis isn't just about seeing what happened, but understanding why it happened and what might happen next. That could really help me predict busy seasons or understand why certain tours are more popular.

I'm getting excited about the possibilities, but I have to ask - what about the quality of my data? I'll be honest, sometimes we forget to record things, or we might have incomplete customer information. Some of our spreadsheets probably have errors too.

Will that be a problem for BI analysis? Can these systems work with messy or incomplete data, or do I need to clean everything up first? I'm worried that all this scattered, imperfect information might not be good enough for the kind of insights you're describing.

---

### **user**:

Quality of data is certainly important to an extent. It's true that we can forget to record things, or spreadsheets have errors, and this can be a pretty major deal for BI. Cleaning up data is an important part of the process. You can definitely end up making bad business decisions based on bad/messy data. Instead of panicking about that though, what you can do is keep entering in valuable data and keeping track of everything from now on. Or simply prioritize that data that is most important for your business.

---

### **assistant**:

That makes sense - I shouldn't let perfect be the enemy of good! I can start cleaning up the most important data while being more careful with new entries going forward.

Actually, this brings up another question. You mentioned earlier that BI can help with things like reporting and data mining. I think I understand reporting - like creating those regular charts and dashboards we talked about. But what exactly is data mining, and how would that be different from the regular analysis we discussed?

Would data mining help me discover things about my tour business that I wouldn't even think to look for? I'm curious if there are hidden patterns in my customer data that could really surprise me!

---

### **user**:

As a refresher, data mining is a process used to uncover patterns and trends in super big data sets. It focuses in a lot on using technology and software and statistics to make sense of information. Reporting communicates this data through charts, dashboards, and useful summaries. It relies more on good presentations and visualizations to get the job done. Data mining is different from regular analysis because it dives deep into the numbers and actual data instead of just observing from the surface. We can see patterns, but what do they mean? That's the idea behind data mining. It would definitely help you discover things about your tour business you wouldn't think to look for! By diving deeper into your data, you might surprise yourself and find hidden information and patterns that would be difficult to spot on the surface!

---

### **assistant**:

Wow, that's fascinating! So data mining could help me find connections I never would have thought to look for. Like maybe certain types of customers always book specific combinations of tours, or there's a pattern between weather and customer satisfaction that I never noticed.

I'm starting to see how powerful this could be for my business. But I have one more practical question - you've mentioned using technology and software for all of this. I'm not very technical, and my team is pretty small. 

Are there BI tools out there that are simple enough for a small tour company like mine to use? Or do I need to hire technical experts to set all this up? I want to make sure this is realistic for a business our size before I get too excited about the possibilities!

---

### **user**:

BI tools are definitely simple enough for a small tour company like yours! Even an individual like me can use visualization tools like Tableau, for example. You do not need to hire technical experts to set anything up. As long as you can familiarize yourself with your systems and how to extract information from your data and how to use that software, you should be good to go. This is very realistic for a small business. These processes are all very simple for anyone to follow. Now that you know what BI can do for you, all you have to do is train yourself with how to use the tools which should be no more difficult than searching up your questions on online videos!

---

### **assistant**:

That's really reassuring to hear! I was worried this would be too complicated or expensive for a small business like ours, but it sounds like we can actually handle this ourselves.

So let me see if I understand the big picture now. I'd start by cleaning up my existing data and organizing it better. Then I could use tools like Tableau to create dashboards and visualizations that help me and my team see patterns - like which countries send us the most customers or what times of year are busiest. And with data mining, I might discover hidden connections that could help me make even smarter decisions about tours, pricing, or marketing.

This could really help us stop guessing about our business and start making decisions based on what the data actually tells us. I'm excited to get started! Do you think there are any specific areas where BI would have the biggest immediate impact for a tour company like mine?

---

### **user**:

That is 100% correct! I think areas where BI would have the biggest impact on your company specifically is by figuring out how to handle reviews and put their views/opinions into place. You can sort out all the positive reviews from the negative reviews and understand what the majority of people are saying. You can also learn where to place most of your marketing allowance by using the information from Google ads and so on. BI will just overall be very useful for your tour company.

---

### **assistant**:

Perfect! Those are exactly the kinds of practical improvements I was hoping for. Being able to systematically analyze reviews instead of just reading through them randomly would be huge - I could finally understand what customers really want and what we need to fix.

And optimizing our marketing spend based on actual data rather than guesswork could save us a lot of money while bringing in more customers.

Thank you so much for walking me through all of this! I feel like I finally understand how Business Intelligence could transform our business. Instead of flying blind with scattered spreadsheets, we could have real insights driving our decisions about everything from tour schedules to marketing campaigns.
